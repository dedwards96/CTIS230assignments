    <h1><strong>Early Mankind</strong></h1>
    <p>After the year 10,000 B.C.E, early mankind transitioned from the Paleolithic lifestyle of hunting and gathering for their food to the much more safe and reliable methods of herding and farming, known as the Neolithic lifestyle. Several different Neolithic communities around the world discovered the methods of doing so independently from each other. By transforming their lifestyle from hunting, gathering, and seeking out their food to one that involved early types of agriculture and domestication of both plants and animals, early humans were able to increase the population of their communities by keeping themselves safe from outside dangers and being able to provide enough food for many people. This lifestyle shift led to the inventions of many technologies that are still used today. These technologies include farming techniques, animal husbandry, textiles, and pottery. These inventions were created by the Neolithic communities out of necessity, but as a result they have shaped the way several things are done and considered in the modern age.</p>
    <p>In addition, the increase in populations led to the early versions of hierarchal societies, with leaders in charge of the resources of the various communities and tasked with distributing these resources to the people. By the year 3000 BCE, it is said that “thousands of agrarian villages dotted the Near East, usually within a day’s walk of one another”. These villages developed, as well as crossroads and trading centers. The Neolithic lifestyle was clearly more popular than the Paleolithic lifestyle, and as a result effectively drove the Paleolithic people to extinction by way of simply being more sustainable in the long run.</p>
    <p>Another early technology invented by the Neolithic communities was a way to track the passage of time and seasons. They did this with large stone monuments that served as a way to observe the motion of the sun and the moon. Examples of early religion started around this era as well, with notable examples that survived to this day. Stonehenge in southwest England and the Moai Heads on Easter Island are famous and very interesting glimpses into ancient ceremonial structures.</p>
