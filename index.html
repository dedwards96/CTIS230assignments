    <h1><strong>What Changes History?</strong></h1>
    <h2><em>By David Edwards</em></h2>
    <p id="firsttest">The debate between what causes changes in history has two major sides to it. One side believes that change is caused by the individual, the other side believes that external forces cause change and people are just along for the ride. When asked which side of this debate I am on, I would say that I believe that it is caused by individuals, and these individuals can cause ripple effects so large that it might be seen as an external factor.</p>
    <p id="buttontest">For example, Alexander the Great, who led his army across much of the world and conquered it in the name of the Roman Empire. This resulted in several nations having to drastically change their way of life, and later in history, influenced how their culture developed. On the other side of the debate, it is commonly agreed that the fall of the Roman Empire was caused by economic instability, social decline, and invasions from other tribes. These factors seem like a combination of different problems that no one individual may have caused, and that is correct in my opinion. However, I think it is possible that due to the Roman Empire expanding so rapidly and widely, that it began to stretch itself too thin. Eventually, several problems began to arise as a result of the empire being too spread thin to properly manage all of its territories. Other nations may have seen this weakness as well and eventually invaded.</p>
    <p>Another example would be how the Chinese Empire was largely unaffected by outside forces for much of its history. This allowed the culture, language, and government to be entirely Chinese. The reason why China was left mostly untouched is due to the geography surrounding it. China was surrounded by large mountain ranges, deserts, and an ocean. While this might not seem at first like any one person caused this to happen, I believe that it is possible that the initial settlers of what would eventually become China saw that the surrounding terrain was difficult to pass and believed that it would be a good place to start a civilization.</p>
    <p class="outro">Most of this is pure speculation on my part, and it is certainly possible that it is not at all true. But most things in the realm of history are left to theory, as most things in history were left unwritten.</p>
